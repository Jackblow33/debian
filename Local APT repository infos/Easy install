You can use different paths:

via apt - sudo apt install /path/to/package

or via dpkg - sudo dpkg -i /path/to/package

If you want to install all packages in directory you can use something like:

sudo apt install /path/to/packages/*


Another way if all packages (with depencecies are in one folder)

sudo apt-get -o dir::cache::archives="Path/to/folder/with/debs" install what ever.

Only tested from me with apt-get not with apt.
