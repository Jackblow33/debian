To install Debian with packages hosted locally, you'll need to create a local APT repository, add your packages to it, and then configure your Debian system to use that repository.
Here's a breakdown of the process:
1. Create a Local APT Repository:

    Set up a directory: Choose a directory on your local machine to serve as the repository.

Use reprepro: reprepro is a tool specifically designed for creating and managing Debian repositories.

    Install reprepro: sudo apt install reprepro

Initialize the repository: sudo reprepro -b /path/to/your/repo/dir initdebian

Sign the repository: For secure APT compatibility, sign the repository using OpenPGP.

    Generate a key: sudo gpg --gen-key

Sign the repository: sudo reprepro -b /path/to/your/repo/dir -y -v sign

2. Add Packages to the Repository:

    Place your .deb files: Copy the Debian packages (.deb files) you want to include in the repository into the pool directory within your repository directory.

Use reprepro to add packages: sudo reprepro -b /path/to/your/repo/dir -y -v dadd /path/to/your/deb/file

3. Configure Your Debian System to Use the Local Repository:

    Edit the sources.list file: Open the sources.list file with your preferred text editor: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
    Add the repository to sources.list: Add a line similar to this, replacing /path/to/your/repo/dir with the actual path to your repository directory: deb file:///path/to/your/repo/dir .
    Update the package lists: sudo apt update

4. Install Packages from the Local Repository:

    Install packages: Use apt to install packages from your local repository: sudo apt install <package_name>

Example:
Let's say you have a .deb file named my-package_1.0-1_amd64.deb in /home/user/packages and your repository directory is /home/user/repo.

    Create the repository:

Code

    sudo reprepro -b /home/user/repo initdebian

    Add the package:

Code

    sudo reprepro -b /home/user/repo -y -v dadd /home/user/packages/my-package_1.0-1_amd64.deb

    Configure sources.list:

Code

    sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

Add this line:
Code

    deb file:///home/user/repo .

    Update and install:

Code

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install my-package

Important Notes:

    Security:
    Ensure your repository directory is secure and only accessible by authorized users.

Dependencies:
Make sure your packages don't have unmet dependencies that are not part of your local repository.
Network:
If you plan to share the repository over a network, you'll need to set up a web server to serve the repository files.
Signing:
Signing the repository and packages is highly recommended for security and integrity.
