I tried this but got massive graphical corruption after suspend/resume.

Turns out that to use the nvidia driver with wayland, the NVIDIA Linux kernel module needs to be loaded with the NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1 module parameter. On my system, this was disabled for some reason, which is why /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/61-gdm.rules disabled wayland.

To check this, run the command:

grep Preserve /proc/driver/nvidia/params

If it is disabled (set to 0) you can enable it by creating the file /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-allocation.conf and add the line:

options nvidia-current NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1

Edit: I forgot about these additional steps. The debian package for the nvidia drivers does not install the scripts for suspend/resume support, but they are included in the documentation/examples so you can install them manually as follows:

Install the systemd service files for nvidia-suspend, nvidia-resume and nvidia-hibernate

sudo cp /usr/share/doc/xserver-xorg-video-nvidia/examples/nvidia-sleep.sh /usr/bin
sudo cp /usr/share/doc/xserver-xorg-video-nvidia/examples/system-sleep/nvidia /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep
sudo cp /usr/share/doc/xserver-xorg-video-nvidia/examples/system/nvidia-* /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable nvidia-hibernate nvidia-resume nvidia-suspend

ou may also need to add the nvidia-drm.modeset=1 to the grub config for your kernel. Create the file /etc/default/grub.d/nvidia-modeset.cfg and add the line

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="$GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX nvidia-drm.modeset=1"

then run sudo update-grub and reboot
