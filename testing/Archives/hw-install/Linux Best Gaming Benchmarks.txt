Here are some games that are well-optimized for Linux and have benchmarks available:

Red Dead Redemption 2: Linux is 20% faster than Windows.
Final Fantasy XV: Linux is 10% faster than Windows.

For benchmarking these games, you can use tools like MangoHUD, which is a Vulkan overlay that can monitor CPU, GPU, and RAM usage, as well as minimum, maximum, and average framerates.
 It can be activated in games running through Steam Proton or in native Linux games using Vulkan.
