sudo apt-get purge gnome-keyring
sudo apt-get install gnome-keyring

sudo journalctl -u gdm.service

# Check if the gnome-keyring package is installed:
sudo apt-get install gnome-keyring

# If the package is installed, try manually starting the gnome-keyring-daemon:
gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=pkcs11,secrets,ssh,gpg

# If the manual start is successful, you can try to enable the gnome-keyring-daemon service to start automatically on boot:
systemctl enable gnome-keyring-daemon

#If the manual start is not successful, check the logs for any error messages or clues about why the gnome-keyring-daemon is not starting:
journalctl -u gnome-keyring-daemon

# Ensure that the user "jack" has the necessary permissions to access the GNOME Keyring. You can try running the following commands:
sudo chown -R jack:jack ~/.local/share/keyrings
sudo chmod -R 700 ~/.local/share/keyrings
If the above steps don't resolve the issue, you may need to investigate further into the GNOME Display Manager (GDM) configuration and setup, as the issue could be related to the overall desktop environment setup.




sudo mkdir -p ~/.local/share/keyrings/
sudo chown -R jack:jack ~/.local/share/keyrings/
sudo chmod -R 700 ~/.local/share/keyrings/
sudo systemctl restart gdm.service



sudo nano /etc/gdm3/daemon.conf

Add the following line under the [daemon] section:

Code

RemoveOtherSessions=false


After making the change, restart the GDM service:

Code

sudo systemctl restart gdm.service


Check the Keyring Directory Permissions:
Verify that the ~/.local/share/keyrings/ directory has the correct permissions:

Code

ls -ld ~/.local/share/keyrings/

The output should show the directory with the correct permissions (e.g., drwx------).

Check the System Logs:
Look for any relevant error messages or clues in the system logs:

Code

    journalctl -xe

    This will show the latest system logs, which may provide more information about the keyring-related issues.

After making this change and restarting the GDM service, the GNOME Keyring should be better integrated with the display manager, and the login issues you were experiencing should be resolved.









gnome-keyring-daemon --start

Check the GNOME Keyring permissions:
Ensure that the "jack" user has the necessary permissions to the ~/.local/share/keyrings/ directory. You can do this by running:

Code
ls -ld ~/.local/share/keyrings/

The output should show that the "jack" user has read and write access to the directory.

Reset the GNOME Keyring:
If the permissions look correct, you can try resetting the GNOME Keyring as mentioned in my previous response:

Code

jack@debian:~$ gnome-keyring-daemon --stop
jack@debian:~$ rm -rf ~/.local/share/keyrings/
jack@debian:~$ gnome-keyring-daemon --start

This will create a new, empty keyring for the "jack" user.
